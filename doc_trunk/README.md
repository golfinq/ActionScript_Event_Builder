# Documentation Trunk

## About

This directory holds the documentation which will be parsed by the code.
`doc_pages.7z` is the copy of all documentation downloaded using the scripts 
in `downloading_app` - which contains a `README.md` of its own for how to use.

## Uncompress

To uncompress I recommend the cross-platform [peazip](https://peazip.github.io). 
Place the files in a `doc_pages` folder in this directory i.e the code 
looks for `.../doc_trunk/doc_pages/...`
